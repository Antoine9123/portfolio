  I started training in computer languages in September 2023. Since then, I’ve
  discovered an insatiable passion for the subject that’s made me want to go
  much further and become a professional. Like Socrates, the more I learn, the
  more I realise that what I know is not enough and the more I’m eager to
  increase my level of knowledge.
